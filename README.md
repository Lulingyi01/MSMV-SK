## Dataset Description

In this paper, we collect a new challenging multi-source synthetic sketch-photo person re-identification dataset called the MSMV-SK dataset. The MSMV-SK dataset is constructed based on four public datasets VIPeR, Market1501, SYSU-MM01, and WePerson. We randomly select identities from these datasets as a reference subset, and the corresponding photos constitute the photo part of the MSMV-SK dataset, with the specific information shown in Table 1.

## Experiment Results
To prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework on cross-domain generalization learning, we select a dataset from Mask1k and MSMV-SK datasets as the training set, and use PKU and Mask1k as the testing set. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with the state-of-the-art methods in Table 2.
